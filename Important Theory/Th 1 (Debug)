Debug :
Debugging is an essential part of software development, which involves identifying, analyzing, and fixing errors or bugs in a program.
Bugs are often logical errors, syntax errors, or runtime errors that prevent a program from executing correctly.
Debugging is the process of locating these issues and resolving them to ensure that the program behaves as expected.
